Directoy structure:
  - runtree 
    This is the folder from where the game will run. If you have anything that
    should be shipped with the game, place it in this folder. By default
    bineriew will be output to this folder. This is where the editor expects to
    find your game.dll and where the final launcher.exe will be generated.

  - runtree/assets
    This folder holds all the assets your game expects to find. When a project
    is created, this folder will be filled up with the default engine assets.
    Add your extra assets here.

  - src
    The src folder is where your source files are expected to be found. All your
    cpp, h, cpp, c or whatever file meant to participate in the building phase
    of your game should live in this folder. You can make subfolders and
    organize this folder's contents to accomodate your project's needs.

  - src/editor
    This folder holds the Cmake script that builds your game as a shared
    library. The editor needs the game to be a shared library so it can load it
    and run it. If a project adds custom editors, this is the place for them.

  - src/launcher
    This folders hosts the source and build script for the game launcher.

  - workspace
    This is where you will find your project's build system files. If you opted
    for a Visual Studio project, the solution and project fils will be generated
    in this folder. Similarly, a Ninja project will generate the .ninja files in
    this folder and a Makefile proejct will generate the Makefiles here as well.

    Keep in mind the workspace is generated by CMake. Lasting changes to the
    project build logic and contents should be made to the project's main
    CMakeLists.txt.
